README:

This is a exercise tracking app called On Track.  On Track allows users to manage a workout log.

On Track has the following features:
    * "Log in" to the website by entering one's name or username.
    * Add workouts associated with a username with the following data: Date, Activity, Length, Effort, and Feeling.  
    * Remove workouts with one click.
    * Workouts are saved persistently to a database and can be viewed at a later time by logging in with the same name.
    * Multiple uses are supported saving to the database from different clients

The activity log is saved to a free external API database available here: https://m3o.com/

To use On Track, clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file.  
Or, simply visit the github pages site located here: https://readlang.github.io/phase-1-project/

For concerned parties about the DB authentication, the DB is a free service with no payment info linked.  
The authentication key only has access to the single DB holding the workout data.
So while this may be bad practice, it was used as a educational oportunity with the worst possible outcome being hacked data on the database.

Users are advised to not enter any data that is considered sensitive.

Thank you for your interest in On Track.
